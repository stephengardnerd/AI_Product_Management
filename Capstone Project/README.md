## Business Case

This problem is important to solve because personalized, timely email marketing significantly impacts customer engagement, leading to higher recurring revenue and improved market share.

Building MailGeniusAI as an AI-powered email marketing tool will streamline and optimize these marketing efforts, thus helping businesses maximize customer retention and drive recurring revenue.

The business case for this product centers on its ability to enhance customer interactions, reducing churn while improving campaign effectiveness. By increasing customer happiness and personalizing experiences, MailGeniusAI will help businesses capture more market share and sustain long-term growth, making it a critical investment for competitive success.

## Application of ML/AI

The problem we aim to solve with MailGeniusAI is the challenge of personalizing email marketing campaigns at scale, which is critical for increasing customer satisfaction and repeat purchases. Many businesses struggle with delivering relevant content to individual customers due to the vast amounts of data available and the need to manually tailor messages. By leveraging ML/AI, MailGeniusAI will automate the process of personalizing email content based on customer behavior, preferences, and historical data, ensuring each customer receives tailored and timely communication. This will help drive customer engagement and improve retention, directly benefiting the business by increasing recurring revenue and customer loyalty.

## Success Metrics

The success metrics for MailGeniusAI will include customer engagement rates (e.g., open and click-through rates), conversion rates, and customer retention rates. These metrics will be clearly defined and measurable through email marketing analytics tools. To establish a baseline, we will gather historical data on current email campaign performance and compare MailGeniusAI’s impact over time. The baseline value will serve as a point of comparison, helping us measure how well AI-driven personalization improves overall engagement and contributes to the business goal of increasing recurring revenue and customer loyalty.

## Data

Data for MailGeniusAI will be primarily sourced from internal email campaign performance metrics, collected through the company’s Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system and email marketing platforms. This strategy reduces the need for costly external datasets. However, to strengthen the Artificial Intelligence (AI) model, anonymized external datasets on email interaction trends may be acquired. To address privacy concerns regarding Personally Identifiable Information (PII), all data will be anonymized before processing, ensuring compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

## Model Building

To build MailGeniusAI, the data science team will consist of several key roles. A Data Scientist will lead model development, focusing on algorithm selection, feature engineering, and model training. A Data Engineer will manage the data pipeline, ensuring that the model can process real-time data and handle large-scale datasets efficiently. A Machine Learning Engineer will help deploy the model, ensuring it is optimized for production use. Additionally, a Business Analyst will work closely with the technical team to translate business objectives into actionable data tasks.

## Evaluating Results

To measure the success of the MailGeniusAI model, key machine learning performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score will be used. A minimum F1 score of 0.90 will be required to ensure high-quality email marketing campaigns that maximize engagement without overwhelming users with irrelevant content.

---

## MVP Design

The MailGeniusAI Minimum Viable Product (MVP) will consist of a streamlined user interface that allows businesses to upload customer email lists, create personalized email templates, and track real-time engagement metrics such as open rates and click-through rates. The MVP will include three key components: the Dashboard for performance metrics, the Email Campaign Builder for creating and personalizing email content, and the Analytics Page for viewing campaign effectiveness over time.
